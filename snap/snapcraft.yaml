description: |
  If you are working on a really important project or job and you want to communicate over messaging, using an encryption is one the best choices. Praiselang provides you a basic reversible encryption/decryption system.
  Praiselang works with Base64 and some basic substitution algorithm together in order to provide a safe encryption/decryption system.
  It is an open-source project and the source code can be found on Github: https://github.com/MertGunduz/praiselang
